=? includes both equality (=) and test (?).

This usage of "=" in these "C-syntax" languages can lead to coding errors.
A programmer may mistype "if (x = y)" instead of "if (x == y)".
In C, the former code fragment roughly means "assign y to x, and if the
new value of x is not zero, execute the statement following".
The latter code fragment roughly means "if and only if x is equal to y,
execute the statement following".¹

In print ≠, meaning not equal to, tests the negated equivalence of two values.¹

And is usually expressed with an infix operator.  In mathematics and
logic, it is usually ∧; in electronics ·; and in programming languages,
& or and.  Some programming languages have a related control structure,
the short-circuit and, written &&, and then, etc.¹

Reserve ∧ for bitwise operations, after the weight of ⊻.

> (⋀) = (&&)
> infixr 3 ⋀

Or is usually expressed with an infix operator.  In mathematics and
logic, it is usually ∨; in electronics, +; and in programming languages,
| or or.  Some programming languages have a related control structure,
the short-circuit or, written ||, or else, etc.¹

Reserve ∨ for bitwise operations, after the weight of ⊻.

In print ≥, meaning greater than or equal to, tests if the value of the
left expression is greater than or equal to that of the right.¹

In print ≤, meaning less than or equal to, tests if the value of the
left expression is less than or equal to that of the right.¹
